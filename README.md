# nanopore-analysis
Data exploration and analysis of a set of Oxford Nanopore reads.
(Still in progress)

The task given was the identification of a species given this mystery set of reads.
Data given: GROUP10.fasta / GROUP10.fastq

## Data Quality Analysis:

Using Nanoplot - https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot

Amazing visualization tool for Nanopore reads. Gives summary statistics and average read quality vs read length plots.

Above hexplot shows average Nanopore read quality ~10 and the longest read ~17,000. It was generated by the following command:

`NanoPlot -t 2 --fastq ../GROUP10.fastq --plots hex --title "Mystery Data" --no-N50`

## Species Identification

Using the GROUP10.fasta file, I first filtered out the 25 longest reads (25LR.fasta).
